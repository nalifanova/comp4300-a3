# Assignment 03 for COMP 4300 Course

--------------------------------------

## Program Specification

In this assignment you will be writing the game that was presented in class.
This game must have the following features:

### Assets: 
- Entities in the game will be rendered using various Textures and Animations
  which we will be calling Assets (along with Fonts)
- Assets are loaded once at the beginning of the program and stored in the Assets
  class, which is stored by the GameEngine class
- All Assets are defined in the assets.txt, with the syntax defined below

### Note:
- All entity positions denote the center of their rectangular sprite. It also 
  denotes the center of the bounding box, if it has one
- This is set via `sprite.setOrigin()` in the Animation class constructor

### Player:
- The player Entity in the game is represented by Megaman, which has several
  different Animations: _Stand_, _Run_, and _Air_. You must determine which
  state the player is currently in and assign the correct Animation.
- The player moves with the following controls:
  Left: A key, Right: D key, Jump: W key, Shoot: Space key
- The player can move left, move right, or shoot at any time during the game
  This means the player can move left/right while in the air
- The player can only jump if it is currently standing on a tile
- If the jump key is held, the player should not continuously jump, but instead
  it should only jump once per button press. If the player lets go of the jump
  key mid-jump, it should start falling back down immediately
- If the player moves left/right, the player's sprite will face in that direction
  until the other direction has been pressed
- Bullets shot by the player travel in the direction the player is facing
- The player collides with `Tile` entities in the level (see level syntax) and
  cannot move through them. The player land on a Tile entity and stand in place
  if it falls on it from above.
- The player does not collide with 'Dec' (decoration) entities in the level
- If the player falls below the bottom of the screen, they respawn at the start
- The player should have a Gravity component which constantly accelerates it
  downward on the screen until it collides with a tile
- The player has a maximum speed specified in the Level file (see below) which it
  should not exceed in either `x` or `y` direction
- The player will be given a CBoundingBox of a size specified in the level file
- The player's sprite and bounding box are centered on the player's position

### Animations:
- See below for Animation asset specification
- Animations are implemented by storing multiple frames inside a texture
- The Animation class handles frame advancement based on animation speed
- You need to implement `Animation::update()` to properly progress animations
- You need to implement `Animation::hasEnded()` which returns true if an
  animation has finished its last frame, false otherwise
- Animations can be repeated (loop forever) or non-repeating (play once)
- Any entity with a non-repeating animation should be destroyed once its
  Animation's `hasEnded()` returns `true` (has finished one cycle)

### Decoration Entities:
- Decoration entities ('Dec' in a level file) are simply drawn to the screen, and
  do not interact with any other entities in the game in any way
- Decorations can be given any Animation in the game, but intuitively they should
  be reserved for things like clouds, bushes, etc

### Tiles:
- Tiles are Entities that define the level geometry and interact with players
- Tiles can be given any Animation that is defined in the Assets file
- Tiles will be given a CBoundingBox equal to the size of the animation
  `tile->getComponent<CAnimation>().animation.getSize()`
- The current animation displayed for a tile can be retrieved with:
  `tile->getComponent<CAnimation>().animation.getName()`
- Tiles have different behaviour depending on which Animation they are given

#### Brick Tiles:
- Brick tiles are given the 'Brick' Animation
- When a brick tile collides with a bullet, or is hit by a player from below:
  - Its animation should change to 'Explosion' (non-repeat)
  - Non-repeating animation entities are destroyed when `hasEnded()` is `true`
  - Its CBoundingBox component should be removed
  
#### Question Tiles:
- Question tiles are given the 'Question' Animation when created
- When a Question tile is hit by a player from below, 2 things happen:
  - Its Animation changes to the darker 'Question2' animation
  - A temporary lifespan entity with the 'Coin' animation should appear for 30
    frames, 64 pixels above the location of the Question entity

### Drawing:
- Entity rendering has been implemented for you, no need to change that system

### Bonus:
- Any special effects which do not alter game play can be added for up to 5% bonus
  marks on the assignment. Note that assignments cannot go above 100% total marks,
  but the 5% bonus can overwrite any marks lost in other areas of the assignment.
- You may develop a 'special weapon' that has special effects which can also
  contribute to the 5% bonus marks available on the assignment.

### Misc:
- The 'P' key should pause the game
- Pressing the 'T' key toggles drawing textures
- Pressing the 'C' key toggles drawing bounding boxes of entities
- Pressing the 'G' key toggles drawing of the grid
- The 'Esc' key should go 'back' to the Main Menu, or quit if on the Main Menu

This should be very helpful for debugging

--------------------------------------

## Level Creation

For this assignment you are also required to create your own level. This level should
include some interesting gameplay. Include this level in the zip file as level.txt.
(P.S. Not sure I'm gonna do that)

--------------------------------------

## Config Files

There will be two configuration files in this assignment. The Assets config file, and 
the level configuration file.

--------------------------------------

## Assets File Specification

There will be three different line types in the Assets file, each of which 
correspond to a different type of Asset. They are as follows:

### Texture Asset Specification:

#### Texture N P

```text
  Texture Name      N       std::string (it will have no spaces)
  Texture FilePath  P       std::string (it will have no spaces)
```

### Animation Asset Specification:

#### Animation

```text
  Animation Name    N       std::string (it will have no spaces)
  Texture Name      T       std::string (refers to an existing texture)
  Frame Count       F       int (number of frames in the Animation)
  Anim Speed        S       int (number of game frames between anim frames)
```

### Font Asset Specification:

#### Font N P

```text
  Font              N       std::string (it will have no spaces)
  Font File Path    P       std::string (it will have no spaces)
```

--------------------------------------

### Level specification File

Game levels will be specified by a level file, which will contain a list of entity 
specifications, one per line. It will also contain a single line which specifies
properties of the player in that level. In this way, you can define an entire level
in the data file, rather than in programming code. The syntax of the lines of the
Level file are as follows.

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

All (GX, GY) positions given in the level specification file are given in 'grid'
coordinates. The 'grid' cells are of size 64x64 pixels, and the entity should be
positioned such that the bottom left corner of its texture is aligned with the
bottom left corner of the given grid coordinate. The grid starts at (0, 0) in the
bottom-left of the screen, and can be seen by pressing the 'G' key while the game
is running.

### Tile Entity Specification:

#### Tile N GX GY

```text
  Animation Name    N       std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
  GX Grid X Pos     GX      float
  GY Grid Y Pos     GY      float
```

### Decoration Entity Specification:

#### Dec N X Y

```text
  Animation Name    N       std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
  X Position        X       float
  Y Position        Y       float
```

### Player Specification:

#### Player X Y CW CH SX SY SM GY B

```text
  GX, GY Grid Pos   X, Y    float, float (starting position of player)
  BoundingBox W/H   CW, CH  float, float
  Left/Right Speed  SX      float
  Jump Speed        SY      float
  Max Speed         SM      float
  Gravity           GY      float
  Bullet Animation  B       std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
```

## Assignment Hints

I recommend approaching this assignment in the following order, which will help you debug your
program along the way with minimal errors. Remember to do one step at a time and test whether
what you have just implemented is working properly before moving on to any additional steps.

- Rendering system has already been set up for you, to help you debug:
  - You can press the T key to toggle drawing textures
  - You can press the C key to toggle drawing bounding boxes
  - You can press the G key to toggle drawing the grid
  
- You can implement `Animation::update()` and `Animation::hasEnded()` at any time, it will not
  affect the gameplay mechanics whatsoever, just animation

- Implement `ScenePlay::loadLevel()`
  - Since rendering is already completed, once you correctly read in the different types of
    entities, add them to the EntityManager and they should automatically be drawn to the
    screen.
  - Add the correct bounding boxes to Tile entities, and no bounding boxes to the Dec entities.
  - Remember you can toggle debug viewing of bounding boxes with the T and C keys

- As part of this step, implement the `ScenePlay::gridToMidPixel()` function, which takes in as
  parameters a grid x, y position and en Entity, and returns the Vec2 position of the CENTER of
  that Entity.
  - You must use the Animation size of the Entity to determine where its center point should be.
  - Keep in mind that this means your Entity MUST have its CAnimation component added first, so
    that can be used to calculate the midpoint in this function.

- Implement `ScenePlay::spawnPlayer()`
  - Read the player configuration from the level file and spawn the player
  - This is where the player should restart when they die.

- Implement some basic WASD u/l/d/r movement for the player entity so that you can use this to
  help test collisions in the future.
  - Remember that you must use `registerAction` to register a new action for the scene.
  - See the actions already registered for you, and the `sDoAction()` function for syntax on how
    to perform actions.

- Implement `ScenePlay::spawnBullet()`
  - Bullet should shoot when Space is pressed in same direction player facing
  - Holding down the space button should not continuously fire bullets. A new bullet can only
    be fired after the space key has been released.
  - Use the entity's `CInput.canShoot` variable to implement this

- Implement `Physics::getOverlap()`
  - This function should return the overlap dimensions between the bounding boxes of two entities.
  - This is the same as the purple rectangle in notes.
  - GetPreviousOverlap should be a copy/paste of this solution except using the previous positions
    instead of the current positions of the entity.
  - If either input entity has no bounding box, then return Vec2(0, 0)

- Implement collision checking with bullets / brick tiles such that the brick is destroyed when
  a bullet collides with it.
  - Remember, a collision occurs when overlap is non-zero in both the X and Y component.
  - Bullets should always be destroyed when they collide with any non-decorative tile

- Implement collision resolution such that when the player collides with a non-decorative tile,
  the player cannot enter it over overlap it.
  - When the player collides with a tile from below, its y-velocity should be set to zero so that
    it falls back downward and doesn't 'hover' below the tile

- Implement a way of detecting which side the player collided with the tile

- Change the controls such that they are the proper left/right/jump style
  - **Note**: All movement logic should be in the movement system.
  - The `sDoAction` system is ONLY used to set the proper CInput variables.
  - If you modify the player's speed or position anywhere inside the sDoAction system, you will
    lose marks as this potentially unsafe / produces unwanted effects

- Implement gravity such that the player falls toward the bottom of the screen and lands on tiles
  when it collides with a tile from above
  - Note that when the player lands on a tile from above, you should set its vertical speed to
    zero so that gravity does not continue to accelerate the player downward
